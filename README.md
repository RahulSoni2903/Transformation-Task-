# 📊 Transformation Task – SSIS ETL Pipeline

This project builds a complete ETL pipeline using SSIS to process client-provided CSV files.
The data is extracted, cleaned, validated, and transformed using SSIS transformation tasks.
Finally, the transformed and quality-checked data is loaded into SQL Server.

## 📁 Source Data Overview

Here, we have a total of **3 business dates**, and for each date there are **2 regional source files**.

**Regions:**

* East
* West

**Dates available in the data:**

* 10/02/2026
* 11/02/2026
* 12/02/2026

So, for each date, two CSV files are received (East and West).

## 🛠️ Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a **professional and reliable ETL pipeline** that:

* reads multiple CSV files received from the client,
* handles **two regions (East and West)**,
* processes data **date-wise**,
* performs required **data cleaning, validation, and transformations**, and
* loads the final, high-quality data into **SQL Server**.

---
### ✅ Client Requirements

* Daily sales data is received from **multiple CSV files** generated by different regional systems.
* Customer names must be **cleaned and standardized** because they are not consistent across files.
* Product codes must be **validated** before loading the data.
* **Invalid and incorrect records** must be identified and handled properly.
* Business requires:

  * **clean and trusted data**
  * **enriched data** for better reporting
  * **aggregated data** for analysis
  * **audit information** for tracking and validation
  * **final structured data loading** for reporting use

---

### ✅ Development Requirements

* Build a complete **SSIS ETL pipeline** to process multiple regional CSV source files.
* Implement **data cleansing and standardization logic** for customer names.
* Perform **product code validation** using the product master reference.
* Separate **valid and invalid records** using appropriate SSIS transformations.
* Apply required **data enrichment and aggregation logic**.
* Capture and store **audit and processing information**.
* Load the processed data into the following master tables:

  * **Dim_Customer_master_table (Customer_master_table)**

    * CustomerId
    * CustomerName
    * City

  * **Dim_Product_master_table (Product_master_table)**

    * ProductCode
    * ProductId
    * Category
