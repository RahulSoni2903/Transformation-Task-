Retail Sales Integration & Data Quality Pipeline
A retail company receives daily sales files from multiple regional systems.

But the data has problems:

- data comes from multiple CSV files

- customer names are not consistent

- product codes need to be validated

- some records are invalid

- business wants:

	-- clean data

	-- enriched data

	-- aggregated data

	-- audit info

	-- and final loading

You must build an SSIS pipeline to prepare data for reporting.


Dev - Create:
Dim_Customer_master_table/ Customer_master_table
CustomerId
CustomerName

Dim_Product_master_table/ Product_master_table

Cache Transform
Fuzzy Lookup
Conditional Split
Multicast
